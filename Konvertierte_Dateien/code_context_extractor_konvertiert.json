    "description": "Given one or more changed code hunks, return just enough surrounding context for solid review or impact analysis. For each hunk the tool: (1) grabs its enclosing function/method/class, (2) lists all imports in the file, (3) shows related global/static/member variables or enums, and (4) lists both callers and callees of that enclosing function. It prefers precise language-server indices, falling back to AST-based fuzzy search when needed. Output is plain text: a header with the file path followed by only the relevant line ranges (original numbers kept). Skip this tool for repo-wide scans that aren't tied to specific hunks.",
